# ICRA2024_Quadruped_Robot_Challenges

Welcome to the official repository for the ICRA 2024 Quadruped Robot Challenges (QRC). This repository serves as a central hub for all participants, providing essential information and updates related to the competition.

## Competition Overview

The ICRA 2024 QRC is a prestigious event that invites teams from around the world to demonstrate the capabilities of their quadruped robots in a series of dynamic and challenging tasks. Building upon the success of the previous year's competition, the 2024 edition promises to be an exciting and innovative experience for all involved.

### 2023 QRC Arena Usage

The 2024 QRC competition arena will be used in a manner very similar to the one from the 2023 edition, with only minor modifications. This is to ensure a consistent level of challenge while introducing new elements to test advancements in quadruped robotics. Detailed schematics and specifications of the 2024 arena will be provided shortly.
