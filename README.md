# ICRA2024_Quadruped_Robot_Challenges

Welcome to the official repository for the ICRA 2024 Quadruped Robot Challenges (QRC). This repository serves as a central hub for all participants, providing essential information and updates related to the competition.

## Competition Overview

The ICRA 2024 QRC is a prestigious event that invites teams from around the world to demonstrate the capabilities of their quadruped robots in a series of dynamic and challenging tasks. Building upon the success of the previous year's competition, the 2024 edition promises to be an exciting and innovative experience for all involved.

### 2023 QRC Arena Usage

The 2024 QRC competition arena will be used in a manner very similar to the one from the 2023 edition, with only minor modifications. This is to ensure a consistent level of challenge while introducing new elements to test advancements in quadruped robotics. Detailed schematics and specifications of the 2024 arena will be provided shortly.

### Simulation Environment

Understanding the importance of preparation, we are currently working diligently to develop and release a simulation environment for the 2024 QRC. This simulated platform will closely mirror the actual competition arena and conditions, allowing teams to effectively test and refine their strategies and algorithms. We anticipate having the simulation environment available for download on this repository in the near future. Stay tuned for updates.

## Getting Started

To get started with the ICRA 2024 QRC:

1. **Familiarize Yourself**: Review the rules and guidelines of the competition, available in the [Competition Rules](https://quadruped-robot-challenges.notion.site/ICRA-2024-Quadruped-Robot-Challenges-d208b535269d4a79b2893a84c1d4b2df) section.
2. **Execute the Simulation Environment**: The simulation map is currently under preparation. Instructions on how to use it will be provided when it is uploaded.
